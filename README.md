# TodoApp - a small side project
> to be linked to a front-end env using Angular (In work)

## _Build a RESTful web service that provides a simple to-do list. The web service should allow the user to perform the following operations:_
- Add a new to-do item.
- Retrieve a list of all to-do items.
- Retrieve a single to-do item by ID.
- Update an existing to-do item.
- Delete a to-do item.

## _Each to-do item should have the following attributes:_
- ID (a unique identifier for the item).
- Title (a short title for the item).
- Description (a longer description of the item).
- Due date (the date by which the item should be completed).
- Status (one of "To Do", "In Progress", or "Done").

> The web service should use a database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store the to-do items, and should use Spring Data JPA to access the database.
